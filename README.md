## Preparing for Initial Client Meeting

Preparing for an initial client meeting with a pet daycare that is having trouble onboarding new employees and customers is the main goal of this project. Demonstrating the capacity to deconstruct activities, seek clarification, and suggest initial tasks to meet the goals of the client is the aim.

### Important Deliverables

1. **Broken Down Criteria:** Pain points and criteria for onboarding process simplification were identified.
2. **Client Questions:** Prepared inquiries to elucidate the client's requirements and anticipations.
3. **Assumptions:** Well-thought-out presumptions that direct the planning phase.
4. **Preliminary Tasks:** Detailed tasks to meet the needs of the client
